Easy Theme for Elgg 1.8.6+    A theme framework - for you to customise - using your own images and colour scheme.  


   ![Examples](http://www.jubo.co.uk/wp-content/themes/jubo/img/easyt.png)


-> Can be used to create a centred panel design using your own background and header image.

-> Can be used to create a 100% page design... and to edit the colours of the default elgg theme.

-> Settings Page - no need to go into the css files - you are guided through the process of customising your elgg design, step-by-step.

-> Custom Index can be styled to match the design…
… and, if you have Custom Index enabled, there is the option of adding a Site Introduction.

-> How to add your own Favicon.

-> How to add a logo.


Important: This theme cannot be used 'out of the box'. Fill in the 'settings' form, SAVE, and the theme will now work. Note: Adding a "Site Introduction" requires the "Custom Index" plugin. This theme is intended as a starting point, I don't expect you to use the design as it is. It is easy to change each section of the theme to match an existing website design, or to create a new design. However, you can start by using the default values and work from there.
(Enable the default settings by going to the settings page and saving.)
